In this file I have tried to give a overview of what needs to be done more concisely than the book.
one way we can distribute the work

programmers 1-3 each write two methods of the ticketManeger class

programmers 4-5 divide the main up evenly

since the bulk of the code is going to be in the class we may want all but one person to work on that 

primary tasks remaining:
someone needs to take on the report method and someone needs to take on the destructor.
I would encourage Jeremy and Petra to take on these tasks

file1 ticketManeger.cpp
class ticketManeger
constructor //pretty much complete author Richard
displayChart  //pretty much complete author Noah
ticketRequest //Haven't tested yet author Richard
purchase //in progress author Derek
report //not started 
destructor //not started

file2 ticketManeger.h
//contents of this file complete

file3 ticketsales.cpp
//contents minor issues remaining author Noah
main
//create var of type TicketManeger

while true
//display menu of options with cout
menu items:
1) display seats  //displayChart
2) request tickets  //ticketRequest purchase 
3) sales report  //report 
4) quit

//get and validate user input with a function in = getInput(1,4)

if menu == 1
TicketManeger.displayChart

if menu == 2
numseats = getInput(0,30)
row = getInput(0,15)
startseat = getInput(0,30)
TicketManeger.ticketRequest
 if buy seat
 while not TicketManeger.purchase(money) //get input until user provides enough money
 money = getInput()

if menu == 3
TicketManeger.report

if menu == 4
exit()
