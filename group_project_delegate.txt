In this file I have tried to give a overview of what needs to be done more concisely than the book.
one way we can distribute the work

programmers 1-3 each write two methods of the ticketManeger class

programmers 4-5 divide the main up evenly

since the bulk of the code is going to be in the class we may want all but one person to work on that 


class ticketManeger
constructor //load files create 2-D array of seat structs
displayChart  //represent seats by a chart of * and # chars
ticketRequest //determine if requested seats are available and if so give the seating price and num of seats
purchase //purchase seats update date accordingly
report //report seats sold seats available and money collected
destructor //write and close files

main
//create var of type TicketManeger

while true
//display menu of options with cout
menu items:
1) display seats  //displayChart
2) request tickets  //ticketRequest purchase 
3) sales report  //report 
4) quit

//get and validate user input with a function in = getInput(1,4)

if menu == 1
TicketManeger.displayChart

if menu == 2
numseats = getInput(0,30)
row = getInput(0,15)
startseat = getInput(0,30)
TicketManeger.ticketRequest
 if buy seat
 while not TicketManeger.purchase(money) //get input until user provides enough money
 money = getInput()

if menu == 3
TicketManeger.report

if menu == 4
exit()
